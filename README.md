# Java REST API using Spring Boot, MongoDB and Postman

This project showcases the development of a robust REST API in Java. This API perform basic CRUD operation and manipulates the data stored in MongoDB database, by utilizing the powerful Spring Boot framework for efficient handling of HTTP requests.




## FAQ

#### What is REST API ?

REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. REST APIs are commonly used  to communicate data among client and server in a specified data format such as JSON, HTML, XML. REST API works on top of HTTP protocol to perform, GET (retrieve data), POST (create new data), PUT (update existing data), DELETE (remove data) operations efficiently in a Database.  In simple, it a light-weighted Architectural design for data inter-change.

#### What is Spring Boot ?

Spring Boot is a powerful Java-based framework that simplifies the process of building, deploying, and managing web applications. By utilizing Spring Boot, the developers can focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code. Spring Boot comes with preconfigured dependencies, making it simple to connect and communicate with various Databases. Spring Boot makes it easy to create RESTful APIs. Apache Tomcat is the default embedded server for Spring Boot. It's a widely used and well-established web server. It's simple to configure and provides good performance.

#### What is MongoDB ?

MongoDB is a NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database that offers a flexible, document-oriented approach to data storage. It stores data in JSON, allowing for dynamic schema and easy scalability.

#### What is Postman ?

Postman is a widely-used and powerful API development and testing tool that simplifies the process of building, documenting, and testing APIs. Postman supports various request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and allows for parameterization, authentication, and handling of headers. Postman helps streamline the API development process.
